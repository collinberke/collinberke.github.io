    "text": "Many coaches call a timeout right before a kicker kicks a field-goal. Does this really do anything?\nIn the NFL many games come down to the last minute and a team could only need a field goal. At this point many coaches still have a timeout. So how does this affect a kicker can some do better and some do worse? Does this distance matter on the kick to determine how well a kicker might do?\nWe need to find the data for fieldgoals and search through to see if there was a timeout called before. So we are going to use nflfastR package so we can go through the NFL play-by-play searching for the results that we want.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflfastR)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggforce)\n\npbp_data &lt;- load_pbp(2018:2023)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# CHUNK 2: Data Cleaning and Variable Creation\npbp_analysis &lt;- pbp_data |&gt;\n  arrange(game_id, play_id) |&gt;\n  mutate(prev_play_is_timeout = lag(timeout, default = 0)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    prev_timeout_team = lag(timeout_team, default = \"NO_TEAM\"),\n    def_team_on_fga = defteam \n  ) \n\nfga_analysis &lt;- pbp_analysis |&gt;\n  filter(play_type == \"field_goal\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(field_goal_result)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    fg_made = case_when(\n      field_goal_result == \"made\" ~ 1,\n      field_goal_result %in% c(\"missed\", \"blocked\") ~ 0,\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_ \n    ),\n    iced_kicker = as.integer(\n      prev_play_is_timeout == 1 & prev_timeout_team == def_team_on_fga\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(fg_made)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(kicker_player_name)) |&gt;\n  select(kicker_player_name, kick_distance, field_goal_result, fg_made, iced_kicker, game_id, play_id)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# REVISED CHUNK 3 Data Preparation for Visualization\ndistance_rates &lt;- fga_analysis |&gt;\n  filter(kick_distance &gt;= 15, kick_distance &lt;= 70) |&gt;\n  mutate(iced_kicker = factor(iced_kicker)) |&gt;

What we find is that there is evidence that “icing” a kicker does something, but a lot more data would be helpful for more support of this point.\n\n\nCode\n#  CHUNK: Beeswarm Plot \n\nbottom_kicker_labels &lt;- kicker_beeswarm_data |&gt;\n  filter(kicker_status == \"Iced Attempts\") |&gt;\n  arrange(success_per_100) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\njitter_width_val &lt;- 0.2 \n\nchart_beeswarm &lt;- kicker_beeswarm_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = kicker_status, y = success_per_100, color = kicker_status)) +\n  \n  geom_point(\n      position = position_jitter(width = jitter_width_val, seed = 42),\n      size = 3.5, \n      alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  \n  geom_text(\n      data = bottom_kicker_labels,\n      aes(label = kicker_player_name),\n      position = position_jitter(width = jitter_width_val, seed = 42), \n      vjust = 2,    \n      hjust = 0.5,  \n      color = \"black\", \n      size = 3.5\n  ) +\n  \n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"errorbar\", \n               aes(ymax = after_stat(y), ymin = after_stat(y)), \n               width = 0.5, linewidth = 1.2, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"text\", \n               aes(label = round(after_stat(y), 1)),\n               vjust = -2, color = \"black\", size = 4.5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Non-Iced Attempts\" = \"skyblue3\", \"Iced Attempts\" = \"firebrick\"),\n    guide = \"none\" # Hide legend as X-axis labels are clear\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 100)) +\n  \nlabs(\n  title = \"Kicker Success Rate Distribution: Iced vs. Non-Iced\",\n  subtitle = paste0(\"Each point is one kicker.

When we look at this we are able to see that the pressure effects every kicker differently. When you look at the graph you are able to see guys like Tyler Bass and Daniel Carlson who kick at a 60% rate when a timeout is called on them.\nIn the end we find that the longer the field goal gets the more the timeout seems to cause them to miss. We also find that some people take pressure better then others and finally that we need way more data if we really want a definitive answer on if “icing” the kicker does anything."
